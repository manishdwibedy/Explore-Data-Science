Set B

1. Review and QA the dataset
a)Missing data

Yes, there are many columns which have a lot of missing data. I considered a threshold of 50% to consider 'lots of missing data'.

However, in this computation, I could not consider all the tables. Thus, I considered only one table - lending_club_2015 in my analysis for missing data.

I did find in my analysis that the missing data is mostly focussed to particular columns. Here, I would like to say, although there were many columns which had some data missing, but the perecentage of missing data were mostly less than 10%. Thereby, I am focussing on the following columns that actually have more than half of the data missing.

The following columns have more than 50% of the data missing. Along I am attaching the  the percentage of data missing in the respective columns:

mths_since_recent_revol_delinq - 64%
mths_since_recent_bc_dlq - 74%
inq_last_12m - 95%
int_fi - 95%
all_util - 95%
max_bal_bc - 95%
open_rv_24m - 95%
il_util - 96%
total_bal_il - 95%
mths_since_rcnt_il - 95%
open_il_24m - 95%
open_il_12m - 95%
open_il_6m - 95%
open_acc_6m - 95%
verification_status_joint - 100%
annual_inc_joint - 100%
dti_joint - 100%
mths_since_last_major_derog - 71%
mths_since_last_record - 81%
desc - 100%



b) erroneous data.

I did find some data as highly erroneous. I defined highly erroneous when the particular value is very far from the cluster mean.

However, in this computation, I could not consider all the tables. Thus, I considered only one table - lending_club_2015 in my analysis for missing data.

I have mostly focused on grade column, and I considered the interdependence with other columns with the grade column.

For example, I considered the distribution of interest rate against the grade. In this case, I found out the around 10 records has highly erroneous data. Considering a specific instance of ID - 55308537, this loan was issued with a interest rate of 6% and the grade was E (sub-grade : E3). However, every loan in the E grade apart from 3 loans were issued with an interest rate of approximately 20% (precisely 17% - 22%). Apart from this loan, ID - 50626827 and 50626827 were also assigned interest rate of around 6%. Moreover, 2 loans of grade D also looked suspicious.

Otherthan these distribution, other columns were fairly uniformly distributed with the grade column.
